# A Weather Story
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization, aims to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe,
while being concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially within the past 10 to 20 years.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to help predict the consequences of climate change, while using machine learning.

# Data Set
The data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project (ECA&D), which recieved support
from the EUMETNET and the European Commission. EUMETNET is a collaborative network comprising
33 European National Meteorological Services.
Moreover, the data is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe,
with data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as
temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation and more.
